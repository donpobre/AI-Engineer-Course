AI Engineering Course — Practice Exercises
This repository contains hands-on exercises completed as part of the Complete AI Engineer Training, focusing on:

- Python Programming
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Transformers
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- LangChain
- Hugging Face
- API Integrations
- Speech & Audio Processing
All exercises use Python with various AI/ML libraries.

📌 1. Speech Recognition
Folder: speech_recognition
This module explores the fundamentals of audio processing, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech in Python.

📂 Files Included

- Setting Up Packages for Speech Recognition.pdf
 Step-by-step package installation and environment setup.

- speech_recognition_python.ipynb
  Jupyter Notebook containing all code implementations for the exercises.

- conda activate speech_env.txt
  Environment creation and required packages list.

🧪 Exercise Overview
1. Loading and Visualizing Audio
- Load the audio file speech_o1.wav
- Visualize waveform and audio properties

2. Speech-to-Text with Google Web Speech API
- Transcribe speech_o1.wav
- Output processed audio as filtered_speech_o1.wav

3. Batch Transcription for Multiple Files
- Automatically read all audio files inside the Recordings/ folder
- Transcribe each file
- Save results to transcriptions.csv
- Enables easy dataset analysis and review

4. Text-to-Speech Conversion
- Read source text from neil_caipang_description.txt
- Convert the text to speech
- Export audio output as output.mp3

✨ Summary

This folder demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of:
- Audio loading
- Speech recognition
- Batch transcription
- Text-to-speech generation

It serves as a foundation for more advanced AI Engineering modules such as NLP, LLMs, and generative AI.
